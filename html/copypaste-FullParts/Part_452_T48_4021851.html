Caution to offerors: The contracting activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information which is not identified in the offer and is not reasonably available to the contracting activity. Accordingly, to assure that sufficient information is available, the offeror must furnish as a part of its offer all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings, or other information) necessary for the contracting activity to (i) determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the solicitation, and (ii) establish exactly what the offeror proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific reference to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the contracting activity.

         <p class="p List1">(b) The AGAR and its subsequent changes are published in:
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Daily issues of the Federal Register,
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Cumulative form in the CFR, and,
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) Electronic form on the USDA Departmental Administration Procurement Homepage (see 401.170).
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) Section 553(a)(2) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, provides an exception from the standard public rulemaking procedures to the extent that the rule involves a matter relating to agency management or personnel or to public property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts. In 1971, Secretary of Agriculture Hardin announced a voluntary partial waiver from the Administrative Procedure Act exception, and USDA agencies generally are required to provide notice and an opportunity for public comment on proposed rules (36 FR 13804, July 24, 1971). The AGAR has been promulgated and may be revised from time to time in accordance with the rulemaking procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act. The USDA also is required to publish for public comment procurement regulations in the Federal Register, pursuant to the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 418b), and FAR 1.301.

         <p class="p P">In individual cases, deviations from either the FAR or the AGAR will be authorized only when essential to effect a necessary acquisition or where special circumstances make such deviations clearly in the best interest of the Government. Except for cost principles, HCA's may approve individual deviations from the AGAR, after coordinating with the General Counsel and the SPE. No deviations from the FAR or AGAR may be authorized at the contracting office level. A copy of each deviation and its supporting documentation shall be provided to the SPE. Deviations from the FAR shall not be made unless such action is authorized by the SPE after consultation with the Office of the General Counsel and any other appropriate office, on the basis of a written justification stating clearly the special circumstances involved.

The SPE shall subsequently inform the Chairperson of the Civilian Agency Acquisition Council of the deviation including the circumstances under which it was required.

</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Immediately inform any person who is performing work as a result of an unauthorized commitment that the work is being performed at that person's risk;

         <p class="p List2">(2) Inform the individual who made the unauthorized commitment of the seriousness of the act and the possible consequences;
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) Ensure that the individual who made the unauthorized commitment furnishes all records and documents concerning the commitment and a complete, written statement of facts, including, but not limited to: a statement as to why a contracting officer was not used; why the vendor was selected and a list of sources considered; a description of work to be performed or products to be furnished; the estimated or agreed price; whether an appropriation is available for the work; and whether performance has begun. Under exceptional circumstances, such as when the individual who made the unauthorized commitment is no longer available to attest to the circumstances of the unauthorized commitment, the ratifying official may waive these requirements; and
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) Decide whether ratification is proper and proceed as follows:
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) If ratification is not justifiable, provide the cognizant program office, contracting office, and the unauthorized contractor with an explanation of the decision not to ratify.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) If ratification appears adequately justified, ratify the action and retain or assign the contract to a successor contracting officer if necessary.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Maintain related approval, decisional, and background documents in the contract file for audit purposes.
</p>

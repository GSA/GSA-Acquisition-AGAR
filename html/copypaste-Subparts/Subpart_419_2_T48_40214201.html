</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) Ensuring that purchases exceeding $2,500 and not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold are reserved exclusively for small businesses, including all preference program areas named in 419.201.

</p>
         <p class="p List1">(f) Upon written request, providing small businesses (in the preference program areas named in 419.201) the bidders' mailing lists of individuals receiving solicitations which will contain the subcontracting clause entitled “Utilization of Small Business Concerns” (FAR 52.219-8).

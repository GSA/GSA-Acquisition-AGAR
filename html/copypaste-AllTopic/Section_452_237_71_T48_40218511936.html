</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(a) The Government is planning a pre-bid/pre-proposal conference, during which potential offerors may obtain a better understanding of the work required.

                                 <p class="p List1">(b) Offerors are encouraged to submit all questions in writing at least five (5) days prior to the conference. Questions will be considered at any time prior to or during the conference; however, offerors will be asked to confirm verbal questions in writing. Subsequent to the conference, an amendment to the solicitation containing an abstract of the questions and answers, and a list of attendees, will be disseminated.

If the answers to conference questions, or any solicitation amendment, create ambiguities, it is the responsibility of the offeror to seek clarification prior to submitting an offer.

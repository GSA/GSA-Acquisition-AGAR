         <p class="p List1">(d) Ensuring that purchases exceeding $2,500 and not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold are reserved exclusively for small businesses, including all preference program areas named in 419.201.

</p>
         <p class="p List1">(l) Reviewing proposed large contract requirements that may be bundled to determine the potential for breaking out components suitable for purchase from small business firms.
